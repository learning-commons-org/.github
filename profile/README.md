## **üß∞ About our AI Developer Tools**  

We‚Äôre building AI infrastructure tools to help edtech tools align more closely with teaching and learning best practices. Our tools focus on improving and evaluating LLM output to ensure AI-powered products are pedagogically sound, standards-aligned, and grounded in research.  
 

[Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/learning-commons-org/knowledge-graph): Improve the accuracy of AI outputs through a structured network of datasets across curricula, state academic standards, and learning science research. Developers can leverage the knowledge graph to improve accuracy, comprehensiveness, and instructional coherence.

[Evaluators](https://github.com/learning-commons-org/evaluators): Assess the instructional quality of educational AI outputs through research-backed educational rubrics and expert-designed scoring systems. With standardized evaluation frameworks and metrics, these tools help assess whether AI-generated content meets high standards of accuracy, pedagogical soundness, and effectiveness.
