##  **üß∞ About our AI developer tools**  

We‚Äôre building open, infrastructural AI tools to help edtech tools better align with the best practices of teaching and learning. Our developer tools are focused on improving and evaluating LLM outputs \- ensuring AI-powered products are pedagogically accurate, standards-aligned, and research-grounded. 

### [**Knowledge Graph**](https://github.com/czi-education/knowledge-graph)

Improve the accuracy of AI outputs through a structured network of datasets across curricula, state academic standards, and learning science research. Developers can leverage our graph to enhance AI accuracy, comprehensiveness, and instructional coherence.

### [**Evaluators**](https://github.com/czi-education/evaluators)

Assess the instructional quality of educational AI outputs through research-backed educational rubrics and expert-designed scoring systems. With standardized evaluation frameworks and metrics, these tools help assess whether AI-generated content meets high standards of accuracy, pedagogical soundness, and effectiveness.
