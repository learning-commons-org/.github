## **About AI Developer Tools for Education**
We're building open, foundational AI infrastructure to accelerate the development of more accurate, state academic standards-aligned, and learning science-backed educational technology products for the public good. Our Developer Tools are focused on improving the quality of LLM outputs, ensuring prompts, responses, and instructional design align with best practices in teaching and learning.

## **Tools**

### [**Knowledge Graph**](https://github.com/czi-education/knowledge-graph)

Our **Knowledge Graph** improves the accuracy of AI outputs through a structured network of datasets across curricula, state academic standards, and learning science research. Developers can leverage our graph to enhance AI accuracy, comprehensiveness, and educational relevance.

### [**Evaluators**](https://github.com/czi-education/evaluators)

Our Evaluators automatically assess the instructional quality of educational AI outputs through research-backed educational rubrics and expert-designed scoring systems. With standardized evaluation frameworks and metrics, these tools help assess whether AI-generated content meets high standards of accuracy, pedagogical soundness, and effectiveness.
